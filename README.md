I see a time very soon when I will be able to use this kind of automation to fill out forms on any website.



## Project Overview

This system automates the process of filling out Toastmasters membership forms by:
- Capturing form field data in a structured format
- Storing member responses separately
- Auto-generating filled forms with provided information

## File Structure

- `convert.py` - Main Python script for form processing
- `toastmasters-form.md` - Original form template in Markdown
- `form_structure.json` - JSON schema defining form fields and properties
- `form_responses.json` - Storage for member responses
- `filled_form.docx` - Generated output file with member information
- `2023 - DIC2 Membership Form.docx` - Original form template

## Documentation

The project documentation is organized in the `cline_docs/` directory:

- [Product Context](cline_docs/productContext.md) - Project purpose and functionality
- [Technical Context](cline_docs/techContext.md) - Technologies and setup
- [System Patterns](cline_docs/systemPatterns.md) - Architecture and design decisions
- [Progress](cline_docs/progress.md) - Development status and roadmap
- [Active Context](cline_docs/activeContext.md) - Current development focus

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- Python for form processing
- JSON for data storage
- Markdown for form templating
- DOCX for final output generation

### Data Organization
The system handles various field types:
- Text inputs
- Checkboxes
- Date fields
- Optional fields
- Multi-line text areas

### File Workflow
1. Form structure defined in `form_structure.json`
2. User responses collected and stored in `form_responses.json`
3. Python script processes data and generates filled form
4. Output saved as DOCX file

## Development Status

Current development status: ðŸŸ¡ In Progress
- Basic structure implemented
- Form analysis completed
- Working on data collection system

## Getting Started

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system
2. Review the form structure in `form_structure.json`
3. Provide member responses in `form_responses.json`
4. Run the conversion script:
   ```bash
   python convert.py
   ```
5. Find the generated form in `filled_form.docx`
